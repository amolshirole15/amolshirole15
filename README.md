🖥️ Hey there! I'm Amol Shirole, an IT professional with over 2 years of hands-on experience crafting dynamic web applications. My journey in technology has been driven by a passion for both frontend and backend development, mastering tools like React JS, Angular 9+, HTML, CSS3, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and NodeJS.

🎓 While my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science laid the groundwork for my career, it's the real-world challenges and innovative solutions I've encountered at Aloha Technology that have truly defined my professional trajectory.

From conceptualization to execution, I thrive on turning ideas into scalable, user-centric software products. Whether it's building responsive user interfaces or architecting robust backend systems, I'm committed to delivering high-quality solutions that exceed expectations.

Outside of coding, I enjoy staying abreast of emerging technologies, refining my skills, and seeking out new opportunities to collaborate and innovate. Let's connect and explore how we can create impactful solutions together!
